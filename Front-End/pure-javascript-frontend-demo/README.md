# Pure HTML, CSS & JavaScript frontend

This project contains a frontend application built by only using html, javascript and css. It uses the fetch api (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
to easily send requests to and handle response from a REST backend serving the data. Example of a REST backend can be found in the same
repository under `/Back-End`

## Getting Started

To run the project you will need to setup a local apache server. This can easily be done using XAMPP. After installing xampp, open it and run
the appropriate services. You then need to move your project folder into a folder called `/htdocs`.

**Example of /htdocs location:**
* [Windows] - C:\xampp\htdocs
* [Linux] - /opt/lampp/htdocs

after completing these steps you can type this in your browser: `http://localhost/project-name-folder`.
The website should then show up with the correct table data retrieved from the database through the REST API.
