## React demo frontend

This project contains a frontend application built using the React framework. It connects to a REST backend serving the data. See the backend projects in this same repository.

To run the project, you will need to set up Node.js environment. Run `npm install` in the project directory to install all the dependency packages (it is a lot, because project uses WebPack for organizing all the Javascript libraries).

To launch the project, execute `npm start` in the console.

For source code research you can start with `src/index.js` file.
